## About

Goro The Ape was an innocent little primate until his fellow humans strapped him
onto a rocket and sent him into orbit.

Eventually, Goro becomes an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts
and lucrative advertising contracts. 

Thanks to the pure rage and hatred he carries due to the cruel betrayal
of the humans he loved and trusted, Goro is able to enter various weight categories
on other planets within the solar system.

Thankfully, this space.py program helps Goro keep track of his target weight by --

- Checking which number planet is equal to.
- Computing their weight on the destination planet.
